### A brief description of who i am.

My name is Ernest Ekene, i was born on the _26th of **July**, 1999_, In Nigeria.
Both parents are Nigerian, so obviously, that makes me a Nigerian.
I am currently 25 at the time of writing this, chasing a career in cloud computing.
Currently, i have a 2X certification in Azure. _Azure fundamental (AZ900)_ & _Azure Administrator Associate (AZ104)_, as a stepping stone to sustaining a career in cloud computing. I am leaning towards cloud security and i am excited for what is yet to come in this choosen path.s
